Dogecoin Balance Watchface

Ever walked down the street and some says "I need to tip you some Doge right now!"? No? Me neither.

But one day...

This face is primarily a template for you to be able to populate your own address onto the face. Using the service CloudPebble, you can import this git and change the QR code and the address in the javascript.

The QR Code needs to be a 144 x 144 PNG (available from multiple QR generators online) and the wallet address is modified in the first line of the JS file.

The balance updates once a minute, and is gathered from Dogechain.info. It intentionally drops the decimal places to keep the face clean and simple.
